## Conclusion

This study, inspired by the article "Assessing the Gender Wage Gap in Turkey, 2002–2019," sheds light on the persistent gender disparities in economic participation, educational attainment, marital status dynamics, and wage levels in Turkey. Using comprehensive datasets and advanced analytical methods, our work has expanded on the findings of the original research, providing a detailed exploration of the factors contributing to the gender wage gap and its evolution over time.

Through the analysis of labor force participation rates, we observed a steady improvement in women's participation in the workforce, reflecting progress in gender inclusivity. However, this growth remains insufficient to close the gap entirely, as societal and institutional barriers continue to disproportionately affect women. Our educational analysis revealed that while women’s access to higher education has significantly increased, disparities at lower educational levels still hinder their full economic integration.

The marital status analysis highlighted shifting dynamics in younger generations, with increasing rates of single women prioritizing education and careers. However, traditional patterns, such as higher widowhood rates for women in older age groups, persist due to social norms and demographic trends.

One of the most significant aspects of this study was the in-depth exploration of the gender wage gap. Using logarithmic transformations and Heckman’s two-step procedure, we identified critical differences in how education, marital status, and tenure impact male and female wages. Discrimination and selection effects emerged as key contributors to the wage gap, underscoring systemic issues that require targeted interventions.

Our approach involved meticulous data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to ensure accurate and meaningful insights. From handling missing data and separating statistical significance markers to creating detailed visualizations with facet charts and boxplots, each step was carefully designed to address the complexity of the issue. These efforts were critical in translating the findings of the article into actionable insights that can inform policy and societal change.

While our study aligns with the article’s findings, it also broadens the perspective by emphasizing the importance of addressing structural inequalities. Our results highlight that education alone is not enough; workplace policies, wage equity measures, and societal attitudes must evolve in tandem to achieve true gender parity.

In conclusion, this work not only reaffirms the findings of the original article but also contributes new perspectives by integrating advanced analyses and visualizations. It serves as a call to action for policymakers, educators, and employers to prioritize gender equality across all domains. The journey toward bridging the gender gap in Turkey is ongoing, and studies like this provide the roadmap for meaningful progress.
