    "text": "Project Topic\nThe aim of the project is to analyze the changes in the gender wage gap in Turkey over the years, understand its components, and draw insights related to social equality.\n\nDescription\nThe Turkish Household Labour Survey (THLS) dataset covers different perspectives of the labor market in Turkey between 2002 and 2019. It includes detailed information on wages, employment status, demographic characteristics, and other labor-related factors. The data provides insights into employment trends, income distribution, and labor force participation rates, with specific information regarding gender, age, education, and employment sectors.\n\n\nWhy Did We Choose This Dataset?\nThe main reason for selecting this dataset is that it offers a comprehensive and rich source of data to explore important labor market issues in Turkey, particularly the gender wage gap. This is a critical topic in the context of modern labor economics and societal equity. With data spanning from 2002 to 2019, it provides a great opportunity for spectacular analysis of trends and patterns, making it ideal for identifying shifts in the gender wage gap over time, as well as analyzing how different demographic factors contribute to it.\n\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nData and Focus: The project analyzed the evolution of the gender wage gap in Turkey over time, considering various factors such as discrimination, endowment differences, and selection effects.\nSignificant Findings: While the impact of discrimination has decreased over time, differences in endowments (e.g., education and experience) still play a significant role in the wage gap.\nConclusions: Reducing disparities in variables like education, marital status, and labor force participation is critical for advancing gender equality in wages.\nPolicy Implications: Addressing structural barriers and promoting inclusive policies can further mitigate the gender wage gap.\nFuture Directions: Continued monitoring and deeper analysis of sectoral and regional variations are needed to develop targeted solutions."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThis study, inspired by the article “Assessing the Gender Wage Gap in Turkey, 2002–2019,” sheds light on the persistent gender disparities in economic participation, educational attainment, marital status dynamics, and wage levels in Turkey. Using comprehensive datasets and advanced analytical methods, our work has expanded on the findings of the original research, providing a detailed exploration of the factors contributing to the gender wage gap and its evolution over time.\nThrough the analysis of labor force participation rates, we observed a steady improvement in women’s participation in the workforce, reflecting progress in gender inclusivity. However, this growth remains insufficient to close the gap entirely, as societal and institutional barriers continue to disproportionately affect women. Our educational analysis revealed that while women’s access to higher education has significantly increased, disparities at lower educational levels still hinder their full economic integration.\nThe marital status analysis highlighted shifting dynamics in younger generations, with increasing rates of single women prioritizing education and careers. However, traditional patterns, such as higher widowhood rates for women in older age groups, persist due to social norms and demographic trends.\nOne of the most significant aspects of this study was the in-depth exploration of the gender wage gap. Using logarithmic transformations and Heckman’s two-step procedure, we identified critical differences in how education, marital status, and tenure impact male and female wages. Discrimination and selection effects emerged as key contributors to the wage gap, underscoring systemic issues that require targeted interventions.\nOur approach involved meticulous data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to ensure accurate and meaningful insights. From handling missing data and separating statistical significance markers to creating detailed visualizations with facet charts and boxplots, each step was carefully designed to address the complexity of the issue. These efforts were critical in translating the findings of the article into actionable insights that can inform policy and societal change.\nWhile our study aligns with the article’s findings, it also broadens the perspective by emphasizing the importance of addressing structural inequalities. Our results highlight that education alone is not enough; workplace policies, wage equity measures, and societal attitudes must evolve in tandem to achieve true gender parity.\nIn conclusion, this work not only reaffirms the findings of the original article but also contributes new perspectives by integrating advanced analyses and visualizations. It serves as a call to action for policymakers, educators, and employers to prioritize gender equality across all domains. The journey toward bridging the gender gap in Turkey is ongoing, and studies like this provide the roadmap for meaningful progress."
